# What is this?
This is a project created by me(Moranth) with help from square_nine. It's **only** the battle system from Min Hero. There is no exp, skill trees, gems, or anythihg like that.The primary purpose of this project is to test new moves and ideas, 
along with giving some insight as to how the moves/minions can be designed in the final game. In the current state, this project will most likely not be very useful, but it is something to build upon.
Once again, this is a VERY barebones and more of a field to test stuff than something which is part of the final game

# How do I run this?
You will need the Godot Engine(Any version above 4.2 should do) [Download Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)

Just download the project(by clicking on code -> Download ZIP. Extract the zip and double click on the *project.godot* file. It *should* open up in godot. If it doesn't, you will have to go to godot, and click on import project, and then select the
project.godot file 

After it is opened, wait for it to load. There will be a lot of errors, don't worry. Then, close godot and reopen it. This time it should open with no errors
You can look in the Wiki for further instructions

# What all is yet to be implemented?
- Type effectiveness i.e. super effective and not effective attacks
- Buffs do technically work, but since we don't know what the algorithm used to calculate them is, they don't have any effect as of now
- The existing moves have not yet been imported, as we are first trying to extract the exact values from the original game in a format that can be imported
- We haven't added battle modifiers/whatever you call it like bubble shields and all, and they are not on our short term things to implement
